        <h2>TERMS & CONDITIONS</h2>
        <p>
        This agreement sets out the terms and conditions on which wireless internet access (“the Service”) is
        provided free of charge to you, a guest, volunteer, or Ranger of the Firefly Arts Collective
        (“Firefly”).
        </p>
        <p>
            Your access to the Service is completely at the discretion of Firefly.  Access to the Service may be
            blocked, suspended, or terminated at any time for any reason including, but not limited to, violation
            of this Agreement, actions that may lead to liability of Firefly, disruption of access to other users or
            networks, and violation of applicable laws or regulations.  Firefly reserves the right to monitor and
            collect all personal information while you are connected to the Service and collected
            information may be used at the discretion of Firefly, including sharing the information with any law
            enforcement agencies, vendors, solicitors, festival camps, hippies, shirtcockers, and/or quasi-military
            organizations.
        </p>
        <p>
            Firefly may revise this Agreement at any time and apply those revisions retroactively. The Agreement
            must be accepted each time you use the Service and it is your responsibility to review it for any
            changes.
        </p>
        <p>
            We reserve the right at all times to withdraw the Service, to change the specifications or manner of use
            of the Service, to change access codes, usernames, passwords or other security information of those
            accessing the Service.
        </p>
        <h2>IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THESE TERMS, INCLUDING CHANGES THERETO, DO NOT ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICE.</h2>

                <h3>Acceptable Use of the Service</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        2.1 You must only use the Service to access Internet Services, or send or receive e- mails, which:
                        <ul>
                            <li>2.1.1  are ridiculous, silly, or full of baloney;</li>

                            <li>2.1.4  contain bad, tacky, or unoriginal art;</li>
                            <li>2.1.5  contain material which anyone in Bring A Cup created, those dorks;</li>
                            <li>2.1.6  in our reasonable opinion may adversely affect the manner in which we carry out our work;</li>

                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>2.2  Music, video, pictures, text and other content on the internet are copyright works and you should download, alter, remix, reappropriate or otherwise use such content for your own devices because nothing is original anymore. Stop kidding yourself.</li>
                    <li>2.3  You must not use the service to distribute Internet Viruses, Trojan Horses, or other destructive software, so wear a virtual condom at all times.</li>
                    <li>2.5  The Service is intended for Firefly guest use only. Access to this Service must not be used for commercial activity. This should probably be higher up on the list of rules.</li>
                    <li>2.6  We may terminate or temporarily suspend the Service if we reasonably believe that you are in breach of any provisions of this agreement including but not limited to clauses 2.1 to 2.5 above. We may also do this if we’re bored, if you’re doing something important, or if you are expecting an important email.</li>
                    <li>2.7  We recommend that you do not use the Service to transmit or receive any confidential information or data and, should you choose to do so, it is at your own risk. Seriously, we’re bad people and we’ll do bad things with it. It’s your ass on the line here.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Criminal Activity</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>3.1  You must not use the Service to engage in any activity which constitutes or is capable of constituting a criminal offence, either in the United States or in any country throughout the world, future, past, or present.</li>
                    <li>3.2  You agree and acknowledge that we will provide assistance and information to law enforcement, governmental agencies and other authorities, even if they don’t ask for it, in the most obnoxious way possible, and blame everything on you.</li>
                    <li>3.3  You agree and acknowledge that we will monitor your activity while you use the Service and keep a log of the Internet Protocol (“IP”) addresses of any devices which access the Service, the times when they have accessed the Service and the activity associated with that IP address</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Other Terms</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>4.1  Under no circumstances will Firefly, Totenkitten, or Camp Blue Screen of Death be liable for consequential, indirect, special, punitive or incidental damages, whether foreseeable or unforeseeable, based on claims of the Guest or its appointees (including, but not limited to, unauthorized access, damage, or theft of your system or data, claims for loss of goodwill, claims for loss of data, use of or reliance on the service, stoppage of other work or impairment of other assets, or damage caused to equipment or programs from any virus or other harmful application), arising out of breach or failure of express or implied warranty, breach of contract, misrepresentation, negligence, strict liability in tort or otherwise. Camp Lamp can be held liable, though.</li>
                    <li>4.2  You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Firefly, Totenkitten, Camp Blue Screen of Death and affiliates from any claim, liability, loss, damage, cost, or expense (including without limitation reasonable attorney's fees) arising out of or related to your use of the Service, any materials downloaded or uploaded through the Service, any actions taken by you in connection with your use of the Service, any violation of any third party's rights or an violation of law or regulation, or any breach of this agreement. This Section will not be construed to limit or exclude any other claims or remedies that the Academy may assert under this Agreement or by law.</li>
                    <li>4.3  This Agreement shall be construed as creating a partnership, joint venture, agency relationship or granting a franchise between the parties. However, this partnership will be entirely one-sided in favor of Firefly. You will be our bitches. Except as otherwise provided above, any waiver, amendment or other modification of this Agreement will be effective without requiring that it be in writing and/or signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable, in whole or in part, such holding will not affect the validity of the other provisions of this Agreement.</li>
                    <li>4.4  Firefly’s performance of this Agreement is subject to existing laws and legal process, and nothing contained in this Agreement shall waive or impede Firefly’s desire to comply with law enforcement requests or requirements relating to your use of this Service or information provided to or gathered by Firefly with respect to sending you up the river into the basin of the hellish American prison system. This Agreement constitutes the complete and entire statement of all terms, conditions and representations of the agreement between you and Firefly with respect to its subject matter and supersedes all prior writings or understanding.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>By agreeing to the terms of service, I confirm that I accept these terms and conditions as the basis of my use of the wireless internet access provided.</p>
